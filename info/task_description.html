    Biologists use bacteria to clone DNA for sequencing.
    These bacteria are injected with the DNA that needs to be
    cloned and then allowed to reproduce on a large plate.
    As these bacteria reproduce they form colonies. Only bacteria
    from healthy colonies will be used for sequencing.
    And here bioinformatics take the game and use techonologies to automitize these process.
</p>
<p>
    Let's represent a plate snapshot as a pixel grid.
    You are given this grid as a binary matrix where 1 is bacteria cell and 0 is empty.
    Our goal is find the largest healthy bacteria colony that grown uniformly.
    Bacteria can grow in four adjacent cells and bacteria colony is a set of bacterias that are connected.
    The healthy colonies are looked as it's represented on the image.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="healthy" src="{{MEDIA}}healthy.svg" alt="healthy"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="healthy" src="{{MEDIA}}healthy.svg" alt="healthy" width="380px"/>
</p>
<p>
    On the next image unhealthy colonies are marked by orange colors. And remember - single cell is not a colony, so
    it can not be counted as healthy colony.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="healthy" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="healthy" src="{{MEDIA}}example.svg" alt="example" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    You should find the largest healthy colony and return coordinates of the center cell. The top-left cell has
    coordinates (0, 0). If on the plate no a healthly colony, then return (0, 0) (or [0, 0]).
    If on the plate several largest colonies with the same size, then return any of them.
</p>

<p>
    Sum two passed ints
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only" title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.png" alt="example" width="392px"/>
    <img class="for_editor_only" title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}example.png" alt="example" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A grid as a tuple of tuples with integers 1/0.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The coordinates of the largest colony as a list or a tuple of two integers.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here we see th mix of modeling, pattern recognition and data structure programing.
    And how to use it for bioinformatics. If to be more correct - how bioinformatics can be useful for classical
    biology.
